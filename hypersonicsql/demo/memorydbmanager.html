<H2>Hypersonic SQL In-Memory Applet: Database Manager</H2>
<APPLET CODE=org.hsql.util.DatabaseManager ARCHIVE=hsql.jar WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0>
<PARAM NAME="database" VALUE=".">
</APPLET>
<P>
In this demo, all data is kept in memory.<BR>
The data will be lost if the program is closed.<BR>
The Database Manager and the database are running<BR>
inside the internet browser.
<P>
<H2>If it does not work</H2>
On some browsers (Netscape 4.6?), the version compiled for 
JDK 1.2 does not work. In the Java Console (Communicator 
/ Extras / Java Console) you will get something like:
<P>
# Verifier error org/hsql/jdbcConnection.getTypeMap()Ljava/util/Map
<P>
This means the class java.util.Map was not found. In JDK 1.1,
this class does not exist. When compiled for 1.2, there is 
a reference this class required to conform the JDBC 2.0 interface. 
This class itself is never used, but the reference is required anyway.
It looks like most verifiers have no problem with this, but some
have.
<P>
The (only) solution for this problem is to recompile (at least the 
client part) for JDK 1.1. You will need to install JDK 1.1 before
you can do this, then see:
